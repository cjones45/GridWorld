Part 1:
1. Not always, it senses where it is and avoids walls and rocks
2. forward
3. it turns and it then moves

7. the flower turns and changes color
8. they change color when a lady buy is on them and then become more black as the bug leaves
9. no rocks stay
10. they cannot, bugs are afraid of each other

Exercises:
1.
0 north
45 northeast
90 east
135 southeast
180 south
225 southwest
270 west
315 northwest
360 north
2. pretty far anywhere within the grid limitations
3. void setcolor()
4. he died (r.i.p.)


Part 2:
1. helps make a bos with that length
2. its a variable to help set the conditional of sidelength
3. so that if there is a problem it will turn around   
4. because it extends another file
5. yes because of the side length variable 
6. no unless its obstructed
7. when the pattern starts over

Part 3:
1. locl.getrow
2. false
3. (4,4)
4. 135
5. adds direction

1. getOccupiedLocations(); (getRows() * getColums) -  getOccupiedLocations();
2. isValid(new Location);
3. able to override child classes or extended
4. it would be just as easy as filling an array list

1. an actor has a color direction and locatiom
2. initial color is blue and north
3. both state but no instance variables
4. a. no the actor is in the grid
b. No if he has been removed it cant be remoed again
c. yes an actor can remove itself and then put itsself back
5. setdirection or change it in bugrunner

1. if(!gr.isValid(next))
 return false;
 2. return (neighbor == null) || (neighbor instanceof Flower); 
 3. isValid because of the position
 4. getajacentlocation to find next location
 5. getlocation getgrid
 6. th bug will removeitsself
 7. yes it is needed its for flowers
 8. easy to see which bug droped it
9. if you remove it no, if else yes
10. Flower flower = new Flower(getColor()
11. 4 times
